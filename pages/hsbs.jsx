                      Health & Safety Business School (HSBS) is a new project we
                      have developed by OSHversity TDC with the sole aim of
                      looking at the business side of Occupational Safety and
                      Health and making it profitable to practitioners. The
                      world is short of trained OSH professionals while most of
                      the trained ones are also retiring. The whole aim of the
                      HSBS project is to train OSH experts from the point of
                      practitioners to Independent OSH Consultants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We also need the knowledge and experiences of the fast
                      retiring OSH Experts in supporting workplace health and
                      safety but this will hardly be achieved if we do not have
                      OSH experts that are trained on how to do personal
                      consulting in the field of OSH. The OSH business landscape
                      is so virgin and this needs to be adequately explored.

                    <h3>The HSBS Proposition</h3>
                    <p>
                      The HSBS been designed as an Eight-Week (8) virtual
                      training and grooming sessions directed at commercial
                      models within the OSH practice with emphasis on OSH
                      Consulting. Each week has two hours tutorial session with
                      a subject expert on the topic scheduled for each week,
                      participants are left with study links and in some cases,
                      even home work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The entire program has 7 topics that will be covered in 7
                      weeks and the final week has been designed for the entire
                      program review, term paper and wrap up. Submission of
                      individual term paper qualifies participants for
                      certificate issuance, these must be submitted two weeks
                      after the programâ€™s wrap up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We have put together an impressive tutorial board made up
                      of experts drawn from different part of the world, these
                      group of people have volunteered their time to help groom
                      participants.

                      We have all been taught clearly on the practice of Health
                      and Safety and this has helped quite a number of us to
                      perform in our various employment but we do not have
                      conversations on Independent OSH Consulting which should
                      be a window for senior experienced OSH professionals and
                      retirees to still make contribution towards workplace
                      health and safety. This is the focus of HSBS, we need to
                      train and groom OSH Practitioners into Independent OSH
                      Consulting and above all, teaching them the skills needed
                      for setting up and managing OSH Consulting Organisations.
                      Opportunities abounds within the economics of OSH but
                      these have not been duly explored, while we feel we have
                      limited number of trained OSH experts globally, a high
                      number of them retire daily and it is high time we looked
                      at ways of keeping their expertise in the system while we
                      train younger graduates to fill in those vacuums. The
                      older practitioners who have worked for 20 years and above
                      saturate the market and make growth difficult for their
                      younger colleagues, teaching and showing them the pathway
                      to OSH Consulting will free up space for people to grow
                      and allow aspiring entrants into the field of practice.
                      This will blossom OSH profession, improve workplace health
                      and safety and create a stretch of opportunities we can
                      all benefit from.
